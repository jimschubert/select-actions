Select Actions is an extension for Google Chrome_

Select Actions creates a context menu which provides actions for selected text or page elements.

It is possible to do the following:

  *  Select text, right-click, choose Actions -> Web -> Search on Bing
  *  Right-click on a page, choose Actions -> Google -> Search on Blogs
  *  Right-click on an RSS feed icon, choose Actions -> Google -> Add to Reader

This extension provides a context menu for text selection.  Better yet, many of the options fall back to selecting the image url, link url, or page url if you haven't selected any text.

Options include:

   - | Actions |
    - |Social|
     - |Share on Facebook|
     - |Share on Twitter|
     - |Note on Facebook|
    - |Web|
     - |Search on Bing|
     - |Search on Wikipedia|
    - |Google|
     - |Add to Calendar|
     - |Add to Bookmarks|
     - |Add to Reader|

To use this extension, just install it and select text with your cursor. Right click on that text and choose "Actions".  Test different options. 

For example, right-click on a link and select Share on Facebook on Share on Twitter.  Go to my page, www.ipreferjim.com, find the RSS feed in the top right corner, right click on that link and select Google -> Add to Reader.  Do other awesome things with this extension and post in the comments!  That will help me come up with new and exciting options.

1.0.1 Now using context menu API. It's much cleaner.
1.0.0.415: Fixes some CSS and add FB Share.
