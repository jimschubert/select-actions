## Things to do

_The Select Actions extension needs the following done:_

  * Create an options page
   * Allow users to add new search engines
   * Provide a Google-like stylesheet
   * Use the auto-save functionality common in extensions (no save/cancel button)
  * Store options in localStorage
   * Merge search links from options page into localStorage
  * Add debugging messages that make sense
   * e.g. try/catch with console.error
  * Proper usage of console.{info|debug|warn|error|log} throughout
  * 'Standardize' the object interface for actions
   * e.g. id, title, fn, description
   * (Note: we can keep metadata in this object, not all need to be used)
